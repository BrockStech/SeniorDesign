## Background Description
We have family members who are or have been disabled and are not able to reach different areas of 
their house. It would be very fulfilling as engineers, to build a rover that could navigate a home using
lines placed on the floor to get from point A to point B. The rover will be equipped with sensors that can
recognize the lines in order to follow them, as well as proximity sensors that can avoid obstacles on the ground
such as clothes and random objects.  This will showcase its retrieval ability. Then it will follow the lines 
back to the user representing the delivery of the requested object. This rover will be 3D printed to make 
initial costs low and broken parts easily replaced. 

## Project Problem Statement
For those who are unfortunately restricted with their mobility, they can often find it difficult to reach areas of
their house for needed items.

## Inadequacy of Current Solutions to Problem
The main benefits of solving this problem would be making someoneâ€™s home safer for them by allowing this
rover to navigate and retrieve trivial things that most of us commonly take for granted. If you are disabled
and have a tough time moving around, getting up to get a glass of water can be a dangerous task. Labor saving 
is another benefit of thisproduct. This could be for a person who just wants the convenience of having a robot 
that can navigate their house and retrieve common objects. This product will also be cost effective due 
to the 3D designed and printed chasse of the rover.
