## Project Abstract
For our project we are tackling the problem of how hard it is for senior citizens receive their medications in their own home. To resolve this problem we are creating The Medicine Delivery Robot. This robot will deliver a personâ€™s medicine to them wherever they are in their home. As a team we have all witnessed senior citizens have a tough time remembering to take their medicine, or to be physically unable to retrieve their medicine. As engineers, it would be fulfilling to build and program a robot that would navigate your home and deliver important medications to the person in need.
