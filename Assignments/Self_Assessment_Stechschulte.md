# Self Assessment Essay
## Brock Stechschulte

This far into our senior design project I believe I have done a great job of keeping to the schedule. 
I have been able to complete all the research and planning tasks as well as get a head start on the development. 
As a team we are right on pace to be able to complete our project with enough time for testing and improvements. 
I have been able to attend biweekly meetings with our project advisor Janet Dong in order to keep me on track for what I need to
accomplish in the upcoming weeks. This has kept me motivated and focused on the project and has improved our project ideas as a whole.
I have also done a good job in completing the required assignments in order to build a professional repository. This repository contains 
all the information that a project should contain in order to be successful. Lastly, I believe I have done a good job in working as a
team member. I have been able to attend and contribute to our project meetings as well as use my software development knowledge to 
steer the team in the right direction for our future implementations.
