## Background Description
For our project we are tackling the problem of how hard it is for senior citizens receive their medications in their own home. To resolve this problem we are creating The Medicine Delivery Robot. This robot will deliver a person’s medicine to them wherever they are in their home. As a team we have all witnessed senior citizens have a tough time remembering to take their medicine, or to be physically unable to retrieve their medicine. As engineers, it would be fulfilling to build and program a robot that would navigate your home and deliver important medications to the person in need. 

## Project Problem Statement
For those who are unfortunately restricted with their mobility, they can often find it difficult to reach areas of
their house for needed items.

## Inadequacy of Current Solutions to Problem
The main benefits of solving this problem would be making someone’s home safer for them by allowing this
robot to navigate and retrieve trivial things that most of us commonly take for granted. If you are disabled
and have a tough time moving around, getting up to your daily medicine can be a dangerous task. Labor saving 
is another benefit of this product. This product will also be cost effective due 
to the 3D designed and printed chasse of the robot.
