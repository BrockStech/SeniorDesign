# Intended Uses

#### The main use of the Medicine Delivery Robot is to make someoneâ€™s home safer for them by allowing this robot to navigate and retrieve trivial things that most of us commonly take for granted. It can retrieve things like water, liquid medicine, capsule medicine and many other items. It can be used for elderly people, those with mobility issues, people with memory problems, or just people that would like a helping hand around the house.
