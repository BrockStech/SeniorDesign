# Scheduling Robot Delivery Times

#### On the web application page you will see two options, 'Request Medicine Delivery Robot' on the left side, and 'Schedule Medicine Delviery Robot' on the right side. In order to schedule delivery times for the robot you will want to focus on the right side. Selecting the dropdown box will bring up a list of all the times you can have your medicine delviered to you.

#### Selecting one of the times from that list will add the scheduled delivery time to your screen. You can select as many delivery times as you need. Once all of your desired delivery times have been selected click the 'Submit' button which is below all the selected delviery times. This will save your delivery times.
