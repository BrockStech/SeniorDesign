# Reset Robot Delivery Times

#### If you no longer want to use the delivery times that you have previously setup, or would like to change the times you will need to reset the delivery times. To do this, first [open the web application](https://github.com/BrockStech/SeniorDesign/blob/master/Assignments/GettingStarted/AccessWebapp.md). Then locate the 'Reset' button on the right hand side. Selecting this button will remove all the delivery times that you have previously scheduled.
